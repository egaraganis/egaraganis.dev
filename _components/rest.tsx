            such a C++ cryptocurrency recommendation engine implementation or
            a bank system's client classifier in Python. I have worked with related
            libraries, including:

            <li>Neo4j Graph Data Science library.</li>
            <li>Elastic and Kibana analytics engine.</li>
            <li>Apache ECharts visualization library.</li>
